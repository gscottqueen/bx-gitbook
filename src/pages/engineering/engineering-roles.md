### Front End Roles

- Developer roles align into three categories; Lead, Senior Developer, and Developer.
- Each category is expected to have skill level inheritance. For example, A Senior Developer will have working knowledge of Version Control and so should it be for Lead Developers.
- While Front End roles are often cross functional team members, there are high level considerations that place skills into practice which include Technical and Administrative contributions.

Generally speaking, the following Administrative skills should be considered for each of the three Developer roles.

### Front End Lead

Our Front End Leads are responsible for projects, people, and innovations. This requires a broad skill set for interacting and communicating with multiple teams and "pre-sales" activities. Often, they will provide training, documentation, ticketing, code-reviews, and mentorship while supporting personnel management. It is expected that leads will have a deeper understanding of the technology stack and how to implement strategic solutions within projects that reduce risk and provide project success.

Responsible for project deliverables, ensuring that:

- Clear descriptions and estimates of technical deliverables support and determine the scope, approach, schedule, and budget.

Responsible for co-leading projects with project manager(s), ensuring that:

- Team design and decisions around technical resources for assignments are accurate and effective.
- Provide information to clients regarding the technical deliverables or project plan.
- Ensure that the project manager is made aware of and understands all technical issues and risks, including the teamâ€™s ability to deliver on-time and within budget.

### Senior Front End Developer

With proven problem-solving skills, Senior Front End Developers typically work more independently and in support of guidance from Front End Leads. They will help to execute and develop solutions from well-rounded technical and user experience considerations providing estimates, risks, and prototypes. Through analysis and experience they should be comfortable working in and taking on many different Front End technologies while pursuing additional depth in both CMS and JavaScript Applications. Mentoring others is an option for those who seek it. However, it is expected that they will support Front End Developers with guidance, technical knowledge, and quality control.

Responsible for theme code and site configuration, ensuring that:

- Code and configuration are organized, well maintained and documented.
- People working on it know how it is organized, and where to add/edit things.
- Responsible for "low level" support for people working on theming or configuration tickets.

### Front End Developer

With skills ranging from entry to mid-level, our Front End Developers will focus mostly on implementing theme code and site configuration. Awareness of expected skills for being effective within projects will be garnered through standard operation procedures and learning opportunities. Code and skill improvements should be tracked and organized with more experienced developers.

Responsible for theme code and site configuration, ensuring that:

- They contribute to the building of web sites by taking design mockups and implementing them in part or in whole within responsive templates and/or themes.
- Code and configuration are maintained, organized, and implemented per guidance and documentation.
