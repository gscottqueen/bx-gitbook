# Mentor Program

## Purpose

Every technology team member has a mentor. These mentors are technology leads who have
had at least 6 months of experince at Bixal. The purpose of this program is to encourage
learning and growth in a lightly structured format and setting. Ultimately this program
the following goals:

* Develop a relationship where the mentor has an ongoing dialog about carrer goals, interests, and and learning.
* For the mentor to understand the current challenges the mentee is facing
with current projects and technology tasks.
* Develop strategies to help allievate challenges and blockers for projects
and learning.
* For the mentor to have an understanding of workload and working to ensure healthy oppertunity for
learning and development.
* To ensure the mentee is on-boarded and informed of bixal technology practices and is
executing technology in the correct way.

## How it works

1. Before the new technology team member starts working, a lead is assigned a mentee.
Both will be introduced within the end of 2 buisness days (preferabbly day 1).
1. Introductions.
1. The mentor will ensure that the mentee has access to all authorized bixal systems
with 2FA enabled. The following is a list of all common services. A mentee may not need
access to these, but this is a good 'checklist' of the basics.
   1. Jira
   1. Bitbucket, Gitlab, Github
   1. AWS, Azure, Platform.sh, Acquia
1. Common software as well.
   1. PHPStorm (if requested)
   1. Sketch
   1. Correct root level access on local systems
1. Introduce them to commmon level components used in projects. For instance, if the mentee
will be working in drupal, show them [Bixal/Drupal-Project](https://github.com/bixal/drupal-project)
and ensure they have what they need to run it.
1. Set up a recurring monthly one-on-one for a half hour. These are mandatory. Even when busy (it's more imporatant then).
If you have to adjust them a few days go ahead. If you just did a performance evualuation (PEP) go ahead
skip one. But if the person is busy on projects that's not an excuse. Mentors should be most involved in 
those situations advocating and helping correct spiking workloads.
1. Ensure the mentee understands that everyone is available to help and teach at Bixal. However, if you are 
not getting the help you need, that the mentor is the mentee's advocate.
