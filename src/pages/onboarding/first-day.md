# Your First Day at Bixal!

Welcome to Bixal! We know you probably have lots of questions and we hope
this guide will help you get answers, or at least where to look! First a few
notes about this technology handbook!

## Welcome to the Bixal Techbook

This guide aims to provide you with a searchable first stop to find out anything
you might need involving technology. This documentation is meant to be simple
and easy to understand. It's primary purpose is for the average employee, not
just those in the technology silo. If you are reading something in here and it
seems out of place, confusing, or needs updating please file an issue at
[https://github.com/bixal/techbook/issues](https://github.com/bixal/techbook/issues).
If you are feeling particularly brave we gladly
accept changes and pull requests! Ask any of the technology staff
to show you how! You can do it from firefox or chrome, and don't
need a lot of technology experience!
